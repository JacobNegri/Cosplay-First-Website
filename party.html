<p> On the first Saturday of every month we hold a "CossiePlay Party" at the Town Hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each Entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6:OOpm and run until 11:00pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who will be taking requests) and dancing is common, but not required. </p>
<h1> Party Guidelines </h1>
	<ul> 
		<li> CossiePlay Party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. </li> 
        <li> Party fees must be paid at the door. CASH or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payements attract a 2% surcharge. </li>
        <li> Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi - paid by the party-goer. </li>
</ul>
